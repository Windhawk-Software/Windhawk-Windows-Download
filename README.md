## 🧠 Overview  

**Windhawk** is a modular Windows **software** designed to customize system behavior and interface elements in a controlled, reversible way. Instead of applying permanent tweaks, it uses independent modules that can be enabled, configured, or disabled at any time.

Each module targets a specific aspect of Windows—such as the taskbar, window behavior, or UI interactions—allowing precise changes without affecting unrelated components. This approach keeps the system stable while giving users meaningful control over how Windows looks and works.

Windhawk suits users who want personalization without risk. Its clean management interface and isolated modules make it easy to experiment, iterate, and revert changes instantly.

## Additional Information  

Windhawk is ideal for users who want to refine Windows to match their workflow without committing to irreversible tweaks. Because every change is isolated, troubleshooting and rollback are straightforward.

For best results, install modules gradually and avoid stacking multiple tweaks that affect the same system area. Creating a restore point before extensive customization is recommended.
